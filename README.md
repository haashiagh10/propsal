# Problem to Solve
Raman Spectroscopy , and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC) are the way to get Raman spectroscpy data.To deal with the data , We want to detect the feature in the liqid by checking the Raman data.
However , the machine to get the spectral data and the model background are not quite clear.
After remove the noise and background in the data , we can implement some algorithm to analyze the data.

# System Architecture
The module should be compatible with NumPy arrays
